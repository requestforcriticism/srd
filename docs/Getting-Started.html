		<p>This system is basically 5e, but I changed how you get new abilities and progress through your &quot;class&quot;. I&#39;ll go though a simple character creation scenario with you here, and I&#39;ll show you where we follow 5e rules, and where they diverge into this new system.</p>
<p>In 5e, there are five common steps to follow when creating a new character. They normally can be done in any order (if you know what you are doing), but the common recomendation is to perofm them in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a race</li>
<li>Pick a class</li>
<li>Get your ability scores (either point buy or )</li>
<li>Define your character and pick a background</li>
<li>Buy/get equipment</li>
</ol>
<p>In 5e, once you have your character you can then go on adventures, gain exp, and level up. These steps are not too diferent here, except that everything yo choose here has a Character Points (CP) value asscociated with it. Every time you gain a new <strong>ability</strong>, it will cost some amount of CP to <em>buy</em> it. At the begining of the game, the GM will give you some amout of CP to create your character with, and award you CP as the campaign goes on to purchase more abilities or level up your class. Below we will use some amount of starting CP to build our character.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: The GM has given us 100 CP to build a new character with. We will spend it in the sections below</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Picking a race</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: There might be a better term to use instead of <em>race</em> but I&#39;ll figure that out later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Races in this game represent different species of playable races that exist within this world. Each race has its own set of abilities that come with it out-of-the-box. Each race has a certain CP cost that the player must pay to use that race in your new character. Once you select a reace, all of that race&#39;s abilities can be added to your character sheet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Sometimes the CP cost of the class is lower than the cost of buying each ability individually later, but this is not garunteed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Some abilities can only be used by members of specific races. Keep this in mind if you find an ability you want to buy for your character.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: We will be using the <strong>Human</strong> race as our character&#39;s new race. The Human CP cost is X, so we will be spending X CP points to aquire this race and it&#39;s abilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because this world exists along a progessing timeline, a race&#39;s abilities might change based on historical events. If a race has timeline constraints or multiple timeline variants, use the variant that defines the abilities.</p>
